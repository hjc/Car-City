## Car City

Simple object oriented hierarchy that relates different types of vehicles, such as motorcycles, cars, trucks, etc.
 to one another and implements them in code.

To run this code, you can run each objects `test()` function (every object that extends Vehicle has one), or you can
 just run index.php in your console and it will run tests for a motorcycle, car, and truck.
